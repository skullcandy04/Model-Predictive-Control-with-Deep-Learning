# Model-Predictive-Control-with-Deep-Learning

In the realm of robotics, achieving precision and control in arm dynamics is pivotal for real-world applications. My project represents a significant milestone in this domain, where I harnessed the synergy of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and deep learning to enable a robot arm to emulate precise ground-truth movements. Here's a glimpse into the project's core achievements:

1. Precision through MPC:
I spearheaded the development of an advanced Model Predictive Control (MPC) system tailored for a robotic arm. The MPC controller was meticulously designed to achieve exact positional imitation of a ground-truth model. This fundamental control system formed the backbone of the project, ensuring the robot arm's movements aligned closely with the desired trajectories

2. Learning Forward Dynamics:
To bolster the robotic arm's capabilities, I conceptualized and trained a deep learning model to grasp the intricacies of forward dynamics. This model was adept at calculating joint velocity and position based on neural network outputs. Through extensive training, the deep learning model became a crucial component in predicting and optimizing the robot arm's movements

3. Integration of Control and Deep Learning:
The crux of this project lay in the seamless integration of MPC and the learned forward model. By effectively combining these two elements, I orchestrated the robot arm to execute movements in harmony with ground-truth modeling. This fusion of control systems and deep learning techniques showcased my expertise in bridging the gap between theory and practice in robotic applications.
